The <span class="attrtag">@date-type</span> attribute records the type of event in the lifecycle, such as “<tt>accepted</tt>”, “<tt>published</tt>”, or “<tt>revised</tt>” dates. In addition, the <a href="n-z7j0.html" target="main" title="Format of Publication"><span class="attrtag">@publication-format</span></a> attribute records the type of format or media, for example,
“<tt>print</tt>”, to which the event happened. In previous versions of this Tag
Set, the two types of information were combined, so an attribute could say that an article was “<tt>ecorrected</tt>”, meaning that the article was in electronic form and that it was corrected. In this Tag Set, the attribute <span class="attrtag">@date-type</span> would take the value “<tt>corrected</tt>” and the <a href="n-z7j0.html" target="main" title="Format of Publication"><span class="attrtag">@publication-format</span></a> attribute would take the value “<tt>electronic</tt>” to convey the same information.</p></div><div class="attrvalueinfo"><h2 class="header">Attribute Values</h2><div class="attrvalues"><h4 class="header"><span class="headerlabel">In Elements</span></h4><h5><a href="n-z3a0.html" target="main" title="Date"><span class="elementtag">&lt;date&gt;</span></a></h5><h5><a href="n-9a70.html" target="main" title="Publication Date"><span class="elementtag">&lt;pub-date&gt;</span></a></h5><table class="attrtable"><tr><th class="attrvalue">Value</th><th class="attrmeaning">Meaning</th></tr><tr class="attrrow"><td class="attrvalue">Text, numbers, or special characters </td><td class="attrmeaning">Typically a word or phrase that names or describes the purpose of a date, for example,
