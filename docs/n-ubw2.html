          (letter, reply, review, short new piece) which is entirely contained within another
          article.</p><p class="para">The containing (main) article, the sub-article(s), or both, are often quite small. For
          example, an article titled “Member News Column” may contain one paragraph
          introducing the news items (main article) and then contain three longer news stories
          (sub-articles). An example of a longer article is a summary article which begins with a
          full review of the literature (main article) and includes several small related essays
          (sub-articles).</p><p class="para">Many journals have regular columns such as “News”, “Book
            Reviews”, or “50 years ago in the journal”, which consist of a
          series of small entries grouped under a single article title. The group as a whole might
          have some introductory material in addition to the title. Each of these columns could be
          tagged as an article with the introductory material as its direct content and the various
          entries as sub-articles.</p><p class="para">How much
metadata goes with a sub-article is a business decision. Sub-articles usually inherit all journal metadata (<a href="n-wzx0.html" target="main" title="Journal Metadata"><span class="elementtag">&lt;journal-meta&gt;</span></a>) from the parent article,  however, the <a href="n-2fg0.html" target="main" title="Sub-article"><span class="elementtag">&lt;sub-article&gt;</span></a> element <em>allows</em> for the inclusion of a full <a href="n-yww0.html" target="main" title="Front Matter"><span class="elementtag">&lt;front&gt;</span></a> (which contains both the journal and article metadata) for the rare instance in which the journal metadata is different from the parent article.
Sub-articles also typically inherit the article’s metadata (<a href="n-4uc0.html" target="main" title="Article Metadata"><span class="elementtag">&lt;article-meta&gt;</span></a>) unless explicitly overridden by using a <a href="n-hvw0.html" target="main" title="<front-stub&gt;"><span class="elementname">Stub Front Metadata</span></a> element or <a href="n-yww0.html" target="main" title="Front Matter"><span class="elementtag">&lt;front&gt;</span></a> element. For example, a sub-article may
need its own article metadata because it begins on a different page than the primary article, it has
different authors than the primary article, or it takes different keywords. Usually the goal is to
keep the <a href="n-hvw0.html" target="main" title="<front-stub&gt;"><span class="elementname">Stub Front Metadata</span></a> of a sub-article as small as possible, listing just the article metadata that is
different from the main article, but a publisher or archive may choose to replicate most or all of the
article metadata inside the sub-article for more accurate record keeping or retrieval. </p><p class="para">The decision of whether one article should be bundled into another, and thus tagged as
          a sub-article rather than a full article in its own right, is subjective. Publishers and
          archives may wish to establish house guidelines for such decisions.</p></div><div class="pagefooter"><h2 class="headname">Journal Publishing Tag Library Proposed NISO JATS Version 1.0</h2><h4 class="pubdate">Version of May 2012</h4></div></body></html>
