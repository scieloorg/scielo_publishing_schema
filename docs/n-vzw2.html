phones, handhelds, eBook readers, and personal computers, as well as the more historically important
print pages and CD-ROMs. Journal articles are provided in a variety of formats including XML, PDF,
HTML, several eBook formats, and DAISY for pronouncing software. At the same time, governmental regulation, and web best practice as promulgated by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), have led to requirements for better access for the visually and motor impaired. For papers that fall in the purview of the United States government the relevant accessibility guidance comes from the <em>Rehabilitation Act of 1973 § 508, as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105 – 220), 29 U.S.C. § 794d</em> (typically known as Section 508). For the web, the W3C has published the <em>WCAG 2.0: Web Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</em> (WCAG 2.0). The two specifications have been declared to be complimentary, with the techniques of the WCAG 2.0 used to meet the stated Section 508 guidelines. At the level applicable to this Tag Set, both of these accessibility frameworks concern themselves with how those with impaired sight or motor control operate a website built for a seeing, fully manipulatory world.</p><p class="para">Section 508 deals with such visual and handling aspects as screen flicker, electronic
forms, scripting, and color. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines range from the recommendation that web pages be well formed, through techniques for pausing and linking, to specifics on web page design. Since the Journal Article Tag Set does not deal with the look and feel or the behavior of a journal article, but rather with the intellectual content, many of the Section 508 guidelines and WCAG 2.0 techniques do not apply <em>directly</em> to this Tag Set. But certain elements and attributes in this Tag Set enable a publisher, archive, author, aggregator, or other interested party to implement Section 508-compliant or WCAG-accessible display of material based on XML documents tagged with this Tag Set. The intent is that this Tag SET <em>should not prevent</em> and <em>should actively enable</em> Section 508 compliance and WCAG techniques of best accessibility practice.</p><p class="para">For example, the Section 508 website (<a href="http://www.section508.gov" target="_new" class="external">http://www.section508.gov</a>), under <em>508 Standards</em>, <em>Subpart B -- Technical Standards</em>, §<em> 1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications</em> (<a href="http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=stdsdoc#Web" target="_new" class="external">http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=stdsdoc#Web</a>), states that “A text equivalent for every non-text element shall be provided”. This Tag Set does not require that each graphic, for example, also have a non-text companion, but there are three enabling elements available within each <a href="n-6cx0.html" target="main" title="Graphic"><span class="elementtag">&lt;graphic&gt;</span></a> element to make that possible.

pronounced in a way that is not reflected in its content or its tagging. The <a href="n-shr0.html" target="main" title="Alternative Text"><span class="attrtag">@alt</span></a> attribute (available on many elements) can be used to record the
pronunciation for screen readers and other accessibility devices. For example, the abbreviation
“WHO” might be better pronounced as “World Health Organization”
(<tt>alt="World Health Organization"</tt>) or as “W.H.O.” than as the word
“who”. The <a href="n-shr0.html" target="main" title="Alternative Text"><span class="attrtag">@alt</span></a> attribute can also be used to provide
the textual interpretation of a symbol such as an emoticon (e.g., for  “;-)” use an
<a href="n-shr0.html" target="main" title="Alternative Text"><span class="attrtag">@alt</span></a> attribute value such as “<tt>alt="smile-wink"</tt>”).</p><p class="para">Sometimes a <span class="elementtag">&lt;label&gt;</span> needs to be pronounced in a way that is not reflected in its content or its tagging.
